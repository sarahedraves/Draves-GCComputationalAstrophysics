    "    - write the coefficients in terms of k - they don't depend directly on x or t, so can evolve the coefficients independently\n",
    "    - if the coefficient is growing with each time step, then that mode will become unstable and actually get worse with a smaller h/more time steps\n",
    "    - for things that can be stable, can use this process to put a condition on what values of h will work\n",
    "    - this analysis is a bit more complicated for the wave equation since there are two variables, but can still create a Fourier series for each with two coefficients and then make a matrix A for the coefficient evolution equations\n",
    "    - if the eigenvalues for that matrix are greater than 1, will be unstable, and can see for the wave equation specifically that no matter how small the h is, it will be unstable"
