    "- will start with basic calculus on the computer like integrals and derivatives - solved problem with modern computers\n",
    "- will also look at linear algebra, regular algebra, etc\n",
    "- complexity of solutions increases for ordinary and partial differential equations\n",
    "- also will talk about scaling and optimization - monte carlo!"
